# how to use
First we install all the packages needed from package-lock file.
```bash
npm install
```

Then we start our server and we will be able to access it from a browser.
```bash
npm start
```

The app will be available at `localhost:3333` by default. If you want to be able
to use it from your local network, search your local IP address and use it
instead of the `localhost` portion of the url.

**This project was made in a windows environment.
It was not tested in others SOs but should work fine**
